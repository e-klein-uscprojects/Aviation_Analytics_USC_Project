## Aviation Analytics â€“ USC Viterbi Projects

I am currently pursuing my studies at the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering. This repository contains academic projects developed through coursework in predictive modeling and strategic optimization. The work herein applies Python-based tools to analyze flight route efficiency, procedural accuracy, and pilot fatigue using simulated aeronautical datasets. These files represent a continued effort to engage with technical modeling in aerospace contexts and a growing commitment to meaningful contributions in aviation systems and geospatial intelligence.

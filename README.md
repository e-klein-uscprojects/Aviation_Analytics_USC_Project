I am currently enrolled in the Communication Analytics program at the University of Southern California. This project represents an early-stage effort to model and visualize aviation data using Python, with an emphasis on operational clarity and reproducible design. While the scope is modest in scale, the tools and logic applied reflect the technical foundation I’ve developed through coursework and independent analysis.

At the core of the project is a simulation of flight route mapping and fatigue scoring. The visual charting was built to represent exertion cycles over time, while the route model traces geographic coordinates between key airport hubs. Data for both components was formatted manually and visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn. A preview table is also included as a snapshot of the flight route dataset.

Each element—from the LAX–JFK flight path to the fatigue line chart—is designed to be portable, interpretable, and display-ready. The repository contains both code and output images housed in the visuals/ folder. My intent is for this work to serve not as a comprehensive analysis, but rather as a proof of concept: a structured, visual-first presentation of aviation metrics.
I appreciate your time in reviewing this project and welcome feedback or critique that may guide its next iteration.
